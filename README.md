# MyGameEngine_OpenGL
Custom game engine with OpenGL graphics


Because of my creative interests in computer graphics and game engines,
I decided to start almost from scratch a custom interactive environment in 3D.

I'm using the GLFW library to have the most needed (creating windows app and reading inputs from user) for starting with OpenGL.


IMPORTANT - Switch to visual studio x86 debug and 32bit platform build.
