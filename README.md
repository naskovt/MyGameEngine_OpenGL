# MyGameEngine_OpenGL
Custom game engine with OpenGL graphics


Because of my creative interests in computer graphics and game engines,
I decided to start almost from scratch a custom interactive environment in 3D.

I'm using the GLFW library to have the most needed (creating windows app and reading inputs from user) for starting with OpenGL.
GLAD library is used for dealing with the OpenGL function definitions and specifications.


IMPORTANT - Switch to visual studio x86 debug and 32bit platform build.
